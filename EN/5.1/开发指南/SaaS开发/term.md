# Terminology explanation

- [**Blueking development framework 2.0**](./开发基础/README.md) : Quickly develop `Python framework` of saas on the platform of blueking paas. The development framework is based on the `django framework` architecture, and on this basis, it is expanded to add the unique functions of blueking system, such as: `authentication`, `ESB call` and `template rendering`, so that developers can focus more on the `logical development` of saas.

- **Blueking paas visit address** : For example, `paas.blueking.com`, the address to visit blueking after the successful [deployment of the private version of blueking](../../部署维护/README.md).

- **Application ID** : {APP_CODE} , The `unique ID` generated after the application is created in the blueking developer center (which can be found in the `blueking paas access address`).

- **Application TOKEN** : {SECRET_KEY} , Create an application in the blueking developer center and generate a `security key` matching the `application ID`
